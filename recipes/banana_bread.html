        banana flavor? Friends and family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.

            <strong>Butter:</strong> A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Bananas:</strong> Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.
        </li>
